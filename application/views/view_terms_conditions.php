              5. Accounts

When you create this account you must provide accurate and up-to-date information. It is important that you maintain and update your details and any other information that you provide to us.

            <p>
            (b) You must maintain your password: You agree not to disclose your password to any third party, and you are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use. You will be fully responsible for activities that relate to your account or your password. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorised use of your account.
            </p>

            <p>
            (c) You must choose an appropriate username: You may not use, as a username, the name of another person (for example, the name of well-known personalities or a name to which you have no connection), brand, or entity, a name that is not lawfully available for use, or a trade name that is subject to any rights of another person or entity, or a name that is offensive, vulgar, or obscene. In the event that issues arise over the use of particular usernames, for example where another person claims that your username appropriates their name, we will consider the circumstances reasonably and may require you to change your username (and we may then reassign your username). If we have asked you to do this and you refuse, we may suspend or cancel your user account. Importantly, and without impacting the above, we do not permit ‘domain squatting’ or ‘domain parking’ or similar, and we may reclaim and reallocate usernames that we reasonably believe have been created for these purposes. You can raise any concerns with us relating to usernames – see clause 16(b) for details.
