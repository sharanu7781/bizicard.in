            (c) Disclosure of personal information to other countries
            </p>

            <p>
            Bizicard may transfer personal information to other countries in which we do business. Bizicard may also subcontract certain activities and share your personal information with third parties located outside of India(which is where we are headquartered).
            </p>
            <p>
            <p>
            The countries in which these organisations are located will vary, but, in the course of our business operations, we generally disclose personal information to organisations located in India, or the United States. Personal data, therefore, may be subject to privacy laws that are different to those in your country. Such transfers are made in order to provide the Bizicard Services and carry out the activities specified in this Privacy Policy. 
            </p>
            </p>
            <p>
            We take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable data protection laws, including entering into data transfer agreements where required. No transfer of your personal information will take place to an organisation or a another country unless we believe there to be adequate controls in place including the security of your data and other personal information. For more details please see section 9 (How do we secure your personal information) below.

              6. How do we use cookies?
            </h5>
            <ul>
              <p>
              (a) To help improve the service we provide through our BizIcard Services, certain information is collected from your browser. This information is collected as statistical information and may include the IP address, browser type, language and access times. This website also uses cookies to track pages visited and information accessed within our website. This information is for statistical reference, site analysis and to remember your details and preferences when you return to that website.
              </p>

              <p>
              (b) In many cases, the tools used on our website record information in a way that does not identify you as an individual. In other cases, information may be personal information in which case this Privacy Policy will apply.
              </p>

              <p>
              (c) Below we summarise why we use cookies and the different types that we use:
              </p>
            </ul>

            <p>
            Necessary cookies: are those that are essential to run our website or to enable you to receive a service that you have requested. For example, to operate a Users’ session or any other request type functionality on the Service.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Performance cookies: are those that collect information about how visitors use and interact with our website so that we can improve it. For example, we use Heap Analytics to track anonymous information about how visitors use our Service. This only collects statistical information such as the number of visitors to the Service, how they arrived there (i.e. via a Google search or another website), whether it is a first-time or return visit, etc.
              </li>
              <li>
                Functionality cookies: are those that remember the choices you make. Without these cookies you may find that certain features are less convenient and reliable. For example, we use these to remember your language and country of choice and to present relevant content or collect statistical information for our User analytics.
              </li>
              <li>
                Marketing cookies: are those that help us deliver advertising that is more relevant to you and your interests. They include third party cookies placed by our partners and other advertisers who share cookie data with us. For example, we use these cookies to re-target our advertising to appropriate audiences within our advertising partners’ platforms, such as Facebook advertising.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            (d) The Bizicard Service may also use third party website tools from time to time, for example data analytics and online survey tools. These third parties have access to your personal information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are prohibited from disclosing or using it for any other purpose. These service providers may change from time to time, but they generally include the following:
            </p>

            1. Google Analytics and Google Adword
            </p>

            <p>
            Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google Inc. that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service. This data is shared with other Google services. Google may use the collected data to contextualise and personalise the ads of its own advertising network. You can opt-out of having made your activity on the Service available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript programs (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from sharing information with Google Analytics about visiting activity.
