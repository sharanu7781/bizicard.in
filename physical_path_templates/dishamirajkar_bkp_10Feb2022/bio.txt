Matter to be put in it

If you’ve ever considered becoming a coach, I’d love to help you.  When I started, I thought I had to KNOW everything about health & fitness...   Not true! Coaches come with all types of knowledge and in all shapes, sizes, ages and fitness levels.

Our team consists of young and old – ages 18 to 73, in fact.  Some of us have run marathons/go to Fitclub/Gym/cycling & others are still trying to lose 30+ or more kgs.  You see, you don’t have to be a cookie-cutter to be successful.

Successful Coaches:

·        Are self-motivated

·        Enjoy helping and encouraging others

·        Have a passion for fitness (although you don’t have to be an expert- just willing to find out information when asked)

·        Are familiar with social media (Facebook,WhatsApp,Instagram!!!)

 

·        Want to work from home and set their own hours

 

·        If you feel you meet the criteria above and would like to find out more about our coaching opportunities,

 

·        Our next coach training starts soon!  I’m looking for self-motivated fitness enthusiasts I can mentor to help grow their own fitness business.

 

·        Tag a friend/family who are interested.
