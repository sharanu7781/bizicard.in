Harini Nischal, Harini D'zine

Bio
I'm Harini Nischal, an artist and educator based out of Mumbai.
For over 20 years, I have been working passionately with a plethora of Indian crafts, textiles and art forms. I have one simple motto in life: to make beautiful things, beautifully and to redefine art as per the choice and prevailing trend. My new brand Harini D'zine, brings a catalogue of charms for Indian women who love to dress elegantly and are selective about their wardrobe.
